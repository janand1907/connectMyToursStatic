    question: "Can the itinerary be customised?",

      "Yes. These itineraries are a starting point — your coordinator can adjust the day plan, stops and pace based on your travel dates, group size and interests.",

    question: "Is the temple darshan itinerary suitable for non-Hindu travellers?",

      "Entry into the temple premises at Guruvayur Sri Krishna Temple is restricted to Hindus, in line with the temple's own guidelines. Our coordinator will share the current entry rules for each temple stop while planning your visit.",

    question: "What does the houseboat cruise include?",
    answer:
      "Cruise duration (day cruise or overnight stay) and meal inclusions depend on the specific houseboat booked for your dates. Your coordinator will confirm the exact details before your trip.",
